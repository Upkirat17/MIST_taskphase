# Solution
<br>
This was my first time coming across frequency mapping and the <b>English Frequency Order</b> `ETAOIN SHRDLU`, so do keep in mind a lot of ChatGPT was used. 
<br><br>

**Basically**, `ETAOIN SHRDLU`  is a list of most used characters in the english language while typing, the lore of which dates back to the era of typewriters. 
<br>
The idea is to map the most frequently appearing emojies as `E`, the second most frequently appearing as `T`, the third most as `A`, and so on.

This will create a skeleton of a statement, that was decoded using GPT, and the statement was the opening line to a the book **Pride and Prejudice** by **Jane Austen**.
<br>
The line is <br>
`It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.`
