# Hill Cipher
<br>
Hill Cipher is a way of encrypting data by assigning values 0-25 to letters A-Z and then encrypting them using a key matrix (mod26).
Decryption involves using the key matrix (mod 26) to find the actual numbers and converting the numbers to alphabets. 

I understood the math behind it, but the code was really complex for me to write on my own so GPT wrote most of it.
